# Abstract

The increasing need for efficient and safe search operations in complex environments has driven innovation in human-robot collaboration. The objective of Human-Robot Collaboration for Search and Retrieval is to develop an advanced system that leverages the Unitree Go 2 robot dog to autonomously explore, identify, and log objects while supporting operators through intuitive voice commands. The system aims to enhance existing search and retrieval methods by integrating machine learning-powered object recognition (using YOLO), voice processing (using Whisper), and feedback generation (using pyttsx3). This integration ensures a balance between autonomy and human guidance. Our goal is to provide an adaptable and user-friendly interface that allows operators to safely and efficiently collaborate with the robot in various operational settings.
