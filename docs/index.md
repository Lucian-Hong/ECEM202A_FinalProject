# Abstract

Human-Robot Collaboration for Search and Retrieval aims to enhance user interaction and operational safety in complex environments. By leveraging the Unitree Go 2 robot dog equipped with a Raspberry Pi 5 AI Kit, the system autonomously explores, identifies, and logs objects while supporting operators with intuitive voice commands. Utilizing YOLO for real-time object detection, Whisper for voice recognition, and pyttsx3 for spoken feedback, this project integrates machine learning with practical human guidance.

The system determines object locations through YOLO's detection capabilities, while voice commands facilitate precise interaction, enabling the robot to respond effectively to operator requests. This approach allows the user to guide the robot for object retrieval or navigation in diverse settings. Success metrics include response time, measured from the moment a voice command is given to the action's completion, with current trials averaging less than one second. Another critical metric is object detection and interaction accuracy, which has shown reliable performance in non-overlapping and varied object arrangements. The project aims to offer an adaptable, user-friendly interface that enables operators to collaborate safely and efficiently with the robot in various operational environments.
